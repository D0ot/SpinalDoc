## What is Spinal
Spinal is a high-level hardware language description language. It can be used as an alternative to VHDL or Verilog and has several advantages over those. However, it is *fully interoperable* with standard VHDL-based EDA tools (simulators and synthetizers) as the output generated by the toolchain is VHDL.
