Getting started with Spinal
===========================

Spinal is an hardware-description language written in Scala. To use it, you must have a valid Java virtual machine @TODO explain that this provides compiler support, intellij and the rest. The build system is SBT.

@TODO 
- Describe what to download
- How to start a project
- Give a piece of very simple example
- Show what is generated

= Requirements / Things to download to get started
@TODO get the things from the SBT project page, note that an IDE is not required (we propose to use IntelliJ but this is not compulsory)

= How to start a project
Once you have downloaded the tools, there are two ways to get started with Spinal progamming.

1. *The simple way* : get a project already setup for you and start programming right away.
1. *The most flexible way* : if you already are familiar with the SBT build system.

= The most simple example 
If you want to try in a Scala file, you will need to `import spinal.core._` 

= Generated code

= What to do next ?
It's up to you be why not have a look at what the [types](types.md) are in Spinal or discover what [primitives]()
