Examples could be split in two familly :

The ones that use traditional implementation approaches and doesn't asks many effort to be understood :

- [Simple ones](/SpinalDoc/spinal/examples/simple_ones/)
- [VGA controller](/SpinalDoc/spinal/examples/vga/)
- [UART controller](/SpinalDoc/spinal/examples/uart/)

The ones that mix programming paradigms and asks to be comfortable with SpinalHDL and software programming to be correctly understood :

- [Memory mapped UART controller](/SpinalDoc/spinal/examples/memory_mapped_uart/)
- [JTAG controller](/SpinalDoc/spinal/examples/jtag/)
