The core language components are as follows:

- [*Clock domains*](#clock_domains), which allow to define and interoperate multiple clock domains within a design
- *Memory instantiation*, which permit the automatic instantiation of RAM and ROM memories.
- *IP instantiation*, using either existing VHDL or Verilog component.

- When / Switch
