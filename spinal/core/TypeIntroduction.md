### Introduction

The language provides 5 base types and 2 composite types that can be used.

- Base types : [`Bool`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/Bool), [`Bits`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/bits), [`UInt`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/Int) for unsigned integers, [`SInt`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/Int) for signed integers and [`Enum`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/enum).
- Composite types : [`Bundle`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/bundle) and [`Vec`](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/types/Vec).

Those types and their usage (with examples) are explained in this Section.

About the fixed point support it's documented [there](/SpinalDoc/spinal/core/utils/#fixed-point)
