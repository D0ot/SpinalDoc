## Document purpose and structure
This site presents the *Spinal* language and how to use it on concrete examples. This documentation also explains how the language is implemented. The documentation is split into different sections:

1. [Languages principles](/) (this document)
1. [Getting started](/SpinalDoc/spinal_getting_started)
1. [Languages types](/SpinalDoc/spinal_types)
1. [Language principles and primitives](/SpinalDoc/spinal_components)

## What is Spinal ?
Spinal is a high-level hardware description language. It can be used as an alternative to VHDL or Verilog and has several advantages over those. 

{% include note.html content="Spinal is *fully interoperable* with standard VHDL-based EDA tools (simulators and synthetizers) as the output generated by the toolchain is VHDL. <br/><br/>It also enables mixed designs where Spinal components interoperate with VHDL or Verilog IPs." %}

### Advantages of using Spinal over VHDL / Verilog
As Spinal is based on a high-level language, it provides several advantages to improve your hardware coding:

1. *No more endless wiring* - Create and connect complex buses like AXI in one single line.
1. *Evolving capabilities* - Create your own buses definition and abstraction layer.
1. *Reduce code size* - by a high factor, especially for wiring. This enables you to have a better overview of your code base, increase your productivity and create fewer headaches.
1. *Free and user friendly IDE* - Thanks to scala world for auto-completion, error highlight, navigation shortcut and many others.
1. *Detailed information about your design* - Directly extract information from your digital design and generate reports that contain information about latency and addresses.
1. *Powerful and easy type conversions* - Bidirectional translation between any data type and bits. Useful to load a complex data structure from a CPU interface.
1. *Loop detection* - Tools check for you that there is no combinatorial loop / latch.
1. *Clock domains safety* - The tools inform you that there is no user unintentional cross clock domain.
1. *Generic design* - There are no restrictions to the genericity of your hardware description by using Scala constructs.

### What are the differences between Chisel VS Spinal ?
It is a very good question ! Why develop a new language when there Chisel has been released 3 years ago ?

[Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/) is the project at the origin of Spinal and Chisel it represents a big step forward compared to common HDL. However, it has several drawbacks for large designs that mix multiple clock domain and external IP (black-boxes). In fact, Chisel show some serious conception issue : 

#### Multiple clock support is awkward:
- Working into a single block with multiple clock is difficult, you can't define "ClockingArea", only creating a module allow it.
- Reset wire is not really integrated into the clock domain notion, sub module loose reset of parent, which is really annoying.
- No support of falling edge clock or active low reset.
- No clock enable support.
- Chisel makes the assumption that every clock wire come from the top level inputs, you don't have access to clock signal.

#### Black box support is far from perfect:
- Generics/Parameters are not really supported.
- Specifying clock inputs for a black box is not supported. You have to use a workaround and you don't have any control on clock signal name that change against your will.

#### Syntax could be better:
- Not pretty literal value syntax, No implicit conversion between Scala and Chisel types.
- Not pretty input/output definition.
- Assignment operator is only checked when you generate the code, the IDE can't check it for you. Bundle assignment operator is weak typed.
- Switch statement doesn't have default case.
- No "Area" notion to give a better structure to the user code.

#### Various issue :
- You can't define function without argument into `Bundles`.
- There is no notion of "Area".
- Using `when`/`otherwise` is not strict in all case. This allows you to generate an asynchronous signal that is not assigned in every case.
- You can't really write a given range of bit into a bit vector.
- The library that is integrated into Chisel and that provides you some utils and useful bus definition is a good intention, but could be so better and more complete

For a lot of the issues mentioned here, an issue/pull request was open on github, without effect. In addition, if we consider the age (3 years at the time of writing) of Chisel, this is a very serious issue and it's why SpinalHDL was created.
